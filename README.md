# NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database – 05.03.21

**Update: In April 2021, the CCRB provided additional data and clarified information they provided to the NYCLU in July 2020. The updated database now includes information on the race or ethnicity of the impacted person and officer, incident location, current employment status of the officer, and other data. The CCRB’s original data set also contained duplicate entries and a number of entries with many missing values. The NYCLU published the data set in full in 2020 and noted where there appeared to be incomplete information. The current version of the database does not include 14,000 confirmed duplicates and 33,000 entries without complaint data.**

**All files in this repository have been updated as of April 2021 to reflect the new information. To access the old version of the database from before April 2021, please navigate to the “Archive” folder.**

`CCRB Complaint Database Raw 04.20.2021.xlsx` is a record of the complaints made by the public to the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). These complaints span two distinct periods: the time since the CCRB started operating as an independent city agency outside the NYPD in 1994 and the prior period when the CCRB operated within the NYPD. The database includes 279,644 unique complaint records involving 48,757 active or former NYPD officers. The database does not include pending complaints for which the CCRB has not completed an investigation as of April 2021.

Using the CCRB complaint history data, which the NYCLU obtained through a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request, the NYCLU built a search tool to make the information more accessible: [nyclu.org/nypdrecords](https://nyclu.org/nypdrecords).  Each row of the database represents a unique complaint made against an NYPD officer, including the officer’s name, race or ethnicity, rank, and command (the NYPD unit where the officer was assigned at the time that the complaint was filed). It is not uncommon for a single police-civilian encounter to result in multiple complaints against the same officer or against multiple officers. Details about the CCRB investigation process can be found on their website. The CCRB also has a tool with up-to-date data on their website but includes less information for each complaint.
